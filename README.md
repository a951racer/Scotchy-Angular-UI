Example app:  http://52.33.10.249:8080

This is my first attempt at building a MEAN app.  I took up scotch as a hobby about the same time I started learning the MEAN stack. Worlds collided and this is the result.

Technically, this is really a MEN app as I haven't Angular-i-fied it yet.  The font-end is strictly EJS. Stay tuned for a new Angular version!

<strong>Install</strong><br>
Being a fairly basic MEaN application, installation should be fairly straightforward, assuming you alread have Node, npm, and MongoDB installed:  

1) Grab the repository
2) Go to Scotchy's root folder
3) npm install
4) npm server
5) Point your browser at http://localhost:3000
6) Enjoy in moderation!

<h2>Functionality</h2>
Join application mascot, Angus McScotchy, III, as you journey through the wonderful world of scotch.  Although targeted at Scottish style whiskeys, the application could be used for any type of whiskey.

<h4>Cabinet</h4>

The cabinet is intended to be your personally curated catalog of scotches.  Here you can record scotches that you've tasted, scotches you own, or scotches that you're merely interested in.  It's your cabinet, fill it however you like!

Add scotches to your virtual cabinet. You can record the name of the distller, the flavor, and the age of each scotch.  You can also specify the style (single malt vs blended) and the region the scotch comes from.  For each scotch, you can also indicate if you have any in your personal stock, and record general comments including bottling notes, tasting notes from other sources, or any other general information you want to record.

You also have the ability to modify any scotches in your cabinet, or delete them altogether :(

<h4>Wish Lists</h4>

Once you have scotches loaded into your cabinet, you can assign them to any number of wish lists.  Create a wish list of scotches you'd like to try.  Create a Chrismas wish list.  Of course lists need not be "wish" lists.  They're handy tools for organizing the scotches in your cabinet into groups or categories however you desire.

<h4>Tastings</h4>

With Scotchy, you can record an unlimited number of personal tastings for any scotch in your cabinet. Record the date, location, and your impressions/tasting notes.  You can also assign a rating (1-5 stars) for that tasting.  All of your rated tastings for a particular scotch will be averaged to give the scotch an overall rating. This not only allows you to record your personal impressions, nose, palate, finish, whatever, each and every time you have a dram, but you can also document the conditions and context for each tasting.  "Enjoyed a dram with dessert of figgy pudding. Five stars." "Ugh, absolultely undrinkable in noisy sports bar paired with waffle fries. Two stars". "Tried a dram at the Wilsons' Christmas party. The party was smashing. The scotch, not so much. One star"

<h4>Notes</h4>

You can record an unlimited number of notes for each scotch in your cabinet. These notes are like a general diary of activies, reminders, or personal information that you want to add to specific members of your cabinet. You can record purchases, maybe document where you first heard about the scotch.  Document when you killed the bottle.  Drams shared with friends.  Anything not related to a tasting, really.

<h4>Summary</h4>

That's all there is to it! A simple app that is your digital notebook/diary as you explore the wonderful world of scotch.
