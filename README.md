# Scotchy - Angular UI

I starting learning Node and Angular stuff around the same time I took up scotch as a hobby.  Worlds colided and "Scotchy" is the result.  Scotchy is a web application that can be used by scotch whisky enthusiasts to document information about their hobby.

Scotchy is architected to be very modular to allow explorations into different back end technologies (e.g. Node/Express/Mongo, .NET, LAMP, etc.) as well as front end technologies (Angular, React, Vue, .NET, etc.) The end result is we'll be able to build any number of Scotchy "stacks" by mixing and matching backend API's with frontend UI's.

This repository represents the first of the UI modules and is written in Angular 4 (ish).
